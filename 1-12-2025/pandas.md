Pandas is a powerful open-source library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures and tools for working with structured data, such as tables or spreadsheets.

What is Pandas?
It is a Python library built on top of NumPy.
Mainly used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Ideal for working with tabular data (rows and columns), similar to Excel or SQL tables.

Core Data Structures

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array (like a column in a spreadsheet).
DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure (like a table with rows and columns).

 Why use Pandas?

Handles missing data easily.
Supports data filtering, grouping, merging, and aggregation.
Can read/write data from multiple sources: CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.
Integrates well with data visualization and machine learning libraries.

Key Features of Pandas

Data Structures
Series: One-dimensional labeled array.
DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled data structure (rows & columns).
Panel (deprecated): For 3D data.

Data Handling
Handles missing data gracefully.
Supports data alignment and label-based indexing.
Efficient for large datasets.

Input/Output
Read/write data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, Parquet, HDF5, etc.
Easy integration with databases and APIs.

Data Operations
Filtering & Selection: Select rows/columns using labels or conditions.
Aggregation & Grouping: Summarize data using groupby().
Merging & Joining: Combine multiple datasets like SQL joins.
Reshaping: Pivot tables, stack/unstack operations.

Performance
Built on NumPy, so it’s fast and memory-efficient.
Supports vectorized operations (no need for loops).
