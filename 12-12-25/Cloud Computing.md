WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is a technology that delivers computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) instead of relying on local hardware or on-premises infrastructure.

Key Features of Cloud Computing

On-Demand Access: You can access resources whenever you need them without manual setup.
Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
Cost Efficiency: Pay only for what you use (often called a pay-as-you-go model).
Accessibility: Access services from anywhere with an internet connection.
Managed Services: Providers handle maintenance, updates, and security.

Types of Cloud Services
Cloud services are generally categorized into three main models:
1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

What it is: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
What you get: Servers, storage, networking, and virtualization.
Use case: Ideal for businesses that want full control over their infrastructure without buying physical hardware.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.


2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

What it is: Provides a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure.
What you get: Operating systems, development tools, database management, and hosting.
Use case: Perfect for developers who want to focus on coding and app development.
Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku.


3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

What it is: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
What you get: Ready-to-use applications accessible via web browsers.
Use case: End-users who need software without installation or maintenance.
Examples: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce.

Deployment Models
Deployment refers to how the cloud infrastructure is set up and accessed:
1. Public Cloud

Definition: Services offered over the public internet and shared among multiple organizations.
Pros: Cost-effective, scalable, easy to access.
Cons: Less control, potential security concerns.
Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.


2. Private Cloud

Definition: Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
Pros: High security, full control, customization.
Cons: Expensive, requires maintenance.
Examples: VMware, OpenStack.


3. Hybrid Cloud

Definition: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
Pros: Flexibility, better security, cost optimization.
Cons: Complex to manage.
Examples: Microsoft Azure Hybrid, AWS Outposts.


4. Community Cloud

Definition: Shared infrastructure for a specific community with common interests (e.g., healthcare, education).
Pros: Cost-sharing, compliance with industry standards.
Cons: Limited scalability.
Examples: Government or research organizations.
